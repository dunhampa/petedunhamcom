I was comtemplating this blog for sometime but my pushed over the edge by this excellent talk: [The unreasonable effectiveness of public work - David Robinson](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work) A paraphased punchline from this talk is that information stored on your own computer is almost always less valuable than information that is openly shared.  


My hope is that a post or link here will eventually find a person that would of otherwise hit the dreaded "no results" from Google when you are looking for insight or answer on an error and problem.
