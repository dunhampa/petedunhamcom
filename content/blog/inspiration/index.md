I was contemplating (procrastinating) this blog for sometime but I was finally pushed over the edge by this excellent talk: 

[The unreasonable effectiveness of public work - David Robinson](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work) 


<div class="columns">
<div class="column is-3"></div>
<div class="column is-6">
<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/th79W4rv67g"" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen
    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe>
</div>

<div>&nbsp</div>

</div>

<div class="column is-3"></div>
</div>

Prior to finding this talk, I had randomly relied on several of David's (the presenter) open source contributions:

*	To understand something [The Beta Distribution](http://varianceexplained.org/statistics/beta_distribution_and_baseball/)
*	To do something [Natural Language Processing](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)
*	And to get better [Tidy Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD993H5FBIY)

This made his talk even more powerful and personal for me since I have directly benefited by some of his stated examples!
