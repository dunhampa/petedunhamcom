I was contemplating (procrastinating) this blog for sometime but I was finally pushed over the edge by this excellent talk: 

[The unreasonable effectiveness of public work - David Robinson](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work) 



<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/th79W4rv67g"" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen
    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe>
</div>


A paraphrased punchline from this talk is that information stored on your own computer is almost always less valuable than information that is openly shared.  


My hope is that a post or link here will eventually find a person that would of otherwise hit the dreaded "no results" from Google when searching for or insight into a problem.
