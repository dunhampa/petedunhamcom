{{< book title="What is Code?" authors="Paul Ford" image="images/What_is_Code.jpg" size="x600">}} This article explains everything on the software spectrum from burning barrels full of cash to what it takes a computer to print an “A” on the screen. 

 The first time I read this.. my mind was blown.

  The full article is available online for free [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/).  

Because of some visual animations I find the online version somewhat difficult to consume. I recommend googling for the PDF and reading that (also free).{{</book>}}

His 3,700-word comment garnered major media and blogger attention for Yegge's pointed commentary criticizing the leanings of the company's technological culture (such as labeling Google+'s minimalist and, in his view, lackluster public platform &quot;a pathetic afterthought&quot;) as well as for his comments about his former employer, Amazon (such as calling Amazon CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> &quot;Dread Pirate Bezos&quot;).

 Read [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/)

Joel cofounded StackOverflow. But before that, he wrote 12 Steps to Better Code which was the precusor to the cultural shift to Agile and DevOps. The 12 steps seem like no-brainers now but that's because Joel articulated them in this post and then this post made its rounds.
