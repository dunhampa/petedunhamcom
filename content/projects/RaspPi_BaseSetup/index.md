# Background

[Raspberry Pis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) (aka "Pis") are small and inexpensive computers that have a variety uses including teaching computing, IoT, and art. Because of there small size and low cost they Pis are perfect for creating and curating interative art. 

I had several older model flat screen 32 inch TVs that were no longer in use around the house as well as inheriting another older model from a family memember.  


### Raspberry Pi Overview
* The computers are approximately the size of two decks of cards. 
* The 4th generation Raspberry Pis (aka Pis) are readily available and include wireless ethernet and dual monitor (1080) capabilities.  
* You can buy a 4th generation Pi for $30 with RAM 2GB of memory or $50 with 4GB of RAM memory

## Step 4: Use Etcher to flash your microSD card

* Unzip downloaded file to an .img
* Insert card into computer
* Open Etcher it should see insert microSD
* Select image and flash card
* Flashing can take a few to many minutes, so be patient
* After flashing Etcher will validate the flash, this takes time to, so continue to be patient.

## Step 5: Boot ya PI

* Get card from your Mac/PC
* Physically insert microSD into PI as designed
* Plug in physical keyboard and mouse
* Plug in monitor
* Plug in the Pie

## Step 6: Walk through One Time Prompts

After the first boot there are some one-time prompt that guides some one time setups:
* Set Country
* Change password
* Setup Screen
